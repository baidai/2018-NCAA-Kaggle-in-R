Kaggle competition NCAA Basketball in R Programming  

In this Kaggle competition I used historical data to make future predictions on basketball games played in each round of the 2018 NCAA Mens and Womens tournament.  

The model predicted the probablity of each team winning or losing to all other opponents.   

Models were scored based upon log loss.  

Used R programming to cleanse and filter data.  

I created various Glm (generalized linear model)  and Random Forest Models to make predictions.
